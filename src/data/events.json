He populated his new city by offering asylum to fugitives and organized the famous Rape of the Sabine Women to provide wives for his male citizens. The legendary founding date became the basis for the Roman calendar (AUC - Ab Urbe Condita, 'from the founding of the city').",

Hannibal, outnumbered nearly two to one, executed a tactical masterpiece. His center deliberately retreated, drawing the Romans forward while his cavalry defeated the Roman horse and his infantry wings enveloped the Roman flanks. The Roman army was surrounded and systematically slaughtered. Approximately 50,000-70,000 Romans died, including the consul Aemilius Paullus and 80 senators. It remains the benchmark for tactical victory, studied in military academies to this day.",

Over the next fifty years, the empire endured constant civil wars, with over 25 claimants to the throne. Simultaneously, the Persians conquered the eastern provinces while Germanic tribes ravaged the Danube and Rhine frontiers. Plague returned, cities shrank, trade collapsed, and the currency was debased. The empire nearly disintegrated, splitting into three parts. Recovery would require fundamental transformation.",
